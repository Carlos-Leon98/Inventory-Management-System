||| Reviewer comments and suggestions go here. Each item should have *at least* one "kudos" and two suggestions for improvement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|**Problem Statement**|1. Accurately describes project purpose<br> 2. Is professional and free of typos, slang, etc.<br> 3. Fully explains the problem and the solution<br> 4. Is understandable by the average person| After Josh explained to me the problem statement of his individual project, it was clear to me from the beginning that the focus on improving the experience of all fishing fans, based on previous bad experiences with different applications, made him decide to create this application. Also providing a solution using a fish scoring program along with a user friendly interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|**Design Documentation**|1. Navigation/flow through the application is logical and easy to use. <br>2. The order in which values are displayed are logical and easy to understand/use <br>3. The order in which the form fields entered are logical and easy to understand/use<br>4. All data discussed/documented (problem statement, flow, db design, etc.) is represented on the screens | As Josh mentioned previously, he had already created a similar program and uses that program as a base to create the logic for this application. At the time of the code review, Josh's main focus was more on the UI of the application, and then integrating the application logic. As a person external to the project I got the interface easy to use for a user who has an idea about the project as well as a user who has no idea about the project. The fishing score result is easy to understand. At the time I saw the application, the only input value was the location (OR the simulated input) which is easy for the user. |
|**Data model/Database**|1. Everything on the screens and problem statement/flow is represented in the model <br> 2. There is at least one 1-to-many relationship.<br> 3. The model represents good database design <br>| We talked mostly about API integration at the time but we couldn't discuss much about databases. At one point in the code review, he explained to me that one of his tables has a one-to-many relationship, however, we did not discuss much about the design of the database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|**Code**|1. Proper Maven project structure is used<br> 2. a .gitignore file for IntelliJ Java projects has been implemented <br> 3. There is not any redundant or copy/paste code in the JSPs or classes<br> 4. Classes are appropriately-sized (no monster classes)<br> Property files are used appropriately: no hard-coded values <br> 5. Logging statements are used rather than System.out.println and printStackTrace.<br> 6. There are appropriate unit tests/code coverage.  7. No sensitive information is visible in the repository (secrets, passwords, etc). | The structure of the project follows the Maven model as explained in the different activities of this class, including the .gitignore, and no redundant code within the JSPs. At the time, there was only one class, which had the setters and getters configured properly. I was not able to confirm if I had already implemented the loggers instead of System.out.println and printStackTrace, since the main focus was the UI, which was what I had made the most progress on. And at the time there was no discussion about any unit test which is already ready to test.                                                            |
